# Discord Active Developer Badge GUI helper.


****You can use this to get yourself the Discord Active Developer badge quickly, with no need to know anything about programming.
To start the proccess, you must make sure you have Python 3.9 installed (Some of the newer versions may require you to have VBS installed, but the 3.9 version has been tested and it works with no added software).**

**Once ready, double click** `runApp.bat`**.**

 **This will start the setup, install the required python libraries, and execute the app.**
**Once the setup is done, a window will pop up**

**Paste your bot token and click `Start bot!`**

**You will see this once the bot is up and running, you can at this point go to the discord server that has your bot inside it, and run** `/badge`

**Once you see these two responses, you're good to go.**
**You can exit out of both of the windows, which will shut down the bot.**
**Up to 24 hours later, you should be able to claim your badge at [this link!](https://discord.com/developers/applications)**

***This project will be updated if Discord's requirements change***
